Curve development follows a strong testing methodology. While testing Ethereum-based protocols can be challenging, the Curve test suite is a powerful tool that shall be used by contributors to help facilitate this task. While the repositories ``curve-contract``, ``curve-dao-contracts`` and ``curve-pool-registry`` are all stand alone repositories where each employs its own test suite, the design of each test suite is similar.

Here, we shall describe how the test suite can be used most effectively for each of these repositories.
