MetaPool Factory
================

The metapool factory allows for permissionless deployment of Curve metapools.

Factory contracts are open source and may be `found on Github <https://github.com/curvefi/curve-factory>`_.

Organization
============

The metapool factory has several core components:

* The :ref:`factory<factory-deployer>` is the main contract used to deploy new metapools. It also acts a registry for finding the deployed pools and querying information about them.
* :ref:`Pools<factory-pools>` are deployed via a proxy contract. The implementation contract targetted by the proxy is determined according to the base pool. This is the same technique used to create pools in Uniswap V1.
* :ref:`Deposit contracts<factory-deposits>` ("zaps") are used for wrapping and unwrapping underlying assets when depositing into or withdrawing from pools.
